Create a premium, modern fintech dashboard for **Football Metrics** with a calm neutral foundation and confident green-led accents. The experience should feel clean, structured, and data-focused, with rounded cards, pill controls, and subtle depth. Include a left navigation area, a utility top bar with search/profile, KPI summary cards, analytics modules, collaboration list, progress gauge, and a high-contrast time tracker media card.

Implement both light and dark themes with identical information architecture and consistent component behavior. Preserve visual hierarchy: strong page heading, clear card titles, bold numeric metrics, and muted helper text. Use only the defined token system: a **primary palette** for main emphasis, a **secondary palette** for supporting emphasis, neutrals for structure/text, and limited accent tokens for statuses and micro-signals.

Token usage rules:
- Primary palette: CTAs, featured KPIs, positive/progress semantics, key highlights.
- Secondary palette: supplementary chart/data emphasis and interaction modulation.
- Neutral grays: backgrounds, cards, borders, body text hierarchy.
- Accent colors: status badges and small categorical indicators only.
- Complex media tokens: only for designated promotional/time-tracker style surfaces and special gradients/shadows.

Responsively adapt across breakpoints from single-column mobile to multi-column desktop while preserving card hierarchy and readability. Keep spacing rhythm, corner radii, and interaction states consistent across all modules.
